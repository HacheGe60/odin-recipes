        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Argentine asado is a traditional barbecue centered on slowly grilling beef (and sometimes pork, lamb, and
          sausages) over wood or charcoal. It’s usually cooked on a parrilla (grill) at low to medium heat so the meat
          renders and browns gradually, resulting in a smoky flavor and tender texture. Common cuts include ribs (asado
          de tira), flank (vacío), brisket (tapa de asado), and chorizo and morcilla.</p>
        <p>More than just a meal, an asado is a social gathering that can last for hours, where people share food,
          conversation, and often simple accompaniments like chimichurri, salsa criolla, salads, and bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Beef cuts (commonly: asado de tira/short ribs, vacío/flank, tapa de asado/brisket cap, matambre/flank
            steak)</li>
          <li>Chorizo (pork sausage)</li>
          <li>Morcilla (blood sausage)</li>
          <li>Salt (coarse salt is typical)</li>
          <li>Wood or charcoal (for the fire)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optional</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Chimichurri (parsley, garlic, oregano, vinegar/lemon, oil, salt, chili flakes)</li>
          <li>Salsa criolla (tomato, onion, bell pepper, vinegar, oil, salt)</li>
          <li>Bread</li>
          <li>Simple salads (lettuce, tomato, onion)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare the fire: light wood or charcoal and let it burn down until you have a steady bed of embers (not
            big flames).</li>
          <li>Preheat the grill (parrilla) and clean it. Keep an area with lower heat for slower cooking.</li>
          <li>Season the meat: pat it dry and salt it generously with coarse salt (many people salt right before
            grilling).</li>
          <li>Start with the sausages (chorizo and morcilla) and thicker cuts that need more time. Place them on the
            cooler side first if the heat is strong.</li>
          <li>Grill slowly: cook mostly on the bone/fat side first, letting the fat render and the meat cook gently.
            Avoid moving it too much.</li>
          <li>Turn when ready: flip only when the first side is nicely browned and releases easily from the grill.</li>
          <li>Manage the heat: add embers as needed and adjust the grill height (or move meat) to prevent burning.</li>
          <li>Check doneness: cook to your preference; thicker cuts may take 45–90 minutes or more depending on size and
            heat.</li>
          <li>Rest the meat: remove from the grill and let it rest for 5–10 minutes before slicing.</li>
          <li>Serve: slice and serve with chimichurri, salsa criolla, bread, and salads.</li>
        </ol>
