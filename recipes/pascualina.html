        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pascualina is a traditional savory pie from the River Plate region (especially Argentina and Uruguay). It’s
          typically made with a thin pastry crust and filled with cooked spinach or Swiss chard mixed with sautéed
          onion, eggs, and ricotta (or another soft cheese). A classic feature is whole eggs placed into the filling so
          that, when sliced, each portion shows a cross-section of cooked egg. It’s commonly eaten warm or at room
          temperature and is popular during Lent and Easter, though it’s enjoyed year-round.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Puff pastry or pie dough (2 sheets, for top and bottom)</li>
          <li>Spinach and/or Swiss chard</li>
          <li>Onion</li>
          <li>Garlic (optional)</li>
          <li>Olive oil or butter</li>
          <li>Ricotta cheese (or another soft cheese)</li>
          <li>Grated Parmesan (optional)</li>
          <li>Eggs (some beaten for the filling + whole eggs to place inside)</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Black Pepper</li>
          <li>Nutmeg (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 190 °C (375 °F).</li>
          <li>Wash the spinach and/or Swiss chard, cook until wilted, then drain very well and chop.</li>
          <li>Sauté chopped onion (and garlic, if using) in olive oil or butter until soft and translucent.</li>
          <li>Mix the cooked greens with the sautéed onion, ricotta, grated Parmesan (optional), 1–2 beaten eggs, salt,
            pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg (optional).</li>
          <li>Line a pie dish with the bottom sheet of dough, letting the excess hang over the edges.</li>
          <li>Pour in the filling and spread it evenly.</li>
          <li>Make several small wells in the filling and crack whole eggs into them (usually 3–6, depending on the pie
            size).</li>
          <li>Cover with the top sheet of dough and seal the edges (trim and crimp).</li>
          <li>Brush the top with beaten egg, then poke a few small holes or slits for steam to escape.</li>
          <li>Bake for 35–45 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and deep golden brown.</li>
          <li>Let it rest 10–15 minutes before slicing (or cool to room temperature).</li>
        </ol>
