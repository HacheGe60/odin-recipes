        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Flan is a classic caramel custard dessert made by baking (or steaming) a smooth mixture of eggs, milk, and
          sugar until it sets. It’s served chilled and inverted onto a plate so the liquid caramel sauce runs over the
          top. The texture is silky and creamy, and it’s popular across Latin America and Spain, often topped with
          whipped cream or dulce de leche depending on the region.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Sugar (for the caramel)</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
          <li>Milk (or a mix of milk and sweetened condensed milk, optional)</li>
          <li>Sugar (for the custard, if not using condensed milk)</li>
          <li>Vanilla extract (or vanilla bean)</li>
          <li>A pinch of salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 160–170 °C (325 °F).</li>
          <li>Make the caramel: melt sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until deep amber, then quickly pour into a
            flan mold or loaf pan and swirl to coat the bottom.</li>
          <li>Make the custard: whisk (or blend) eggs, milk (and sugar if using), vanilla, and a pinch of salt until
            smooth (avoid too much foam).</li>
          <li>Pour the custard into the caramel-coated mold. Strain it through a fine sieve for an extra-smooth texture
            (optional but recommended).</li>
          <li>Bake in a water bath: place the mold in a larger baking dish and pour hot water around it to reach halfway
            up the sides.</li>
          <li>Bake 45–70 minutes, until the edges are set and the center still jiggles slightly.</li>
          <li>Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 4 hours (ideally overnight).</li>
          <li>Unmold: run a knife around the edge, place a plate on top, flip, and lift the mold so the caramel pours
            over the flan.</li>
        </ol>
