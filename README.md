# Recipes Website (HTML)

## Introduction
This project is a simple recipe website built using basic HTML. It will include a main `index.html` page that links to a few individual recipe pages. The website will not look very polished at this stage, since the focus is on practicing HTML fundamentals. Styling will be added later when the project is revisited with CSS.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:
- Create a multi-page website using HTML
- Structure content with proper semantic elements
- Use links to navigate between pages
- Organize files and directories for a small web project
- Write a clear project description in a `README.md`
